* Fluent is an ORM framework for Swift. It takes advantage of Swift's strong type system to provide an easy-to-use interface for your database. Using Fluent centers around the creation of model types which represent data structures in your database. These models are then used to perform create, read, update, and delete operations instead of writing raw queries.

2. Postgress
* PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance

3. Docker
* Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

4. Postman
* Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated
